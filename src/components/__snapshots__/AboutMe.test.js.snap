  <p>
    I am a full-stack software developer in Portland, OR. My diverse background working with large data-sets, creative problem solving, and managing diverse communities has given me the skills to adapt to any environment. Learning to play roller derby as an adult has taught me that I can learn anything that I put my mind to.
